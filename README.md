# Hardware Mod

A Software Inc. modification that allows you to start with mainboard development.
This mod was forked from [AlbinoGeek](https://github.com/AlbinoGeek/Hardware-Mod) to add a more details mainboard development path.

## Hardware Components

#### Motherboard
Motherboards require an investment in time and resources, as well as a *new specialization:* **Physical Design** for your employees!  However, everyone needs a Motherboard to have a Computer, so it's an entirely new market of customers; if you can handle it.  The competition is very iterative, and will continue releasing "not so very different" versions; just like real life!
